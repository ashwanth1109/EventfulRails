## THE IDEA 💡
Starting out, we didn't really have an idea of what this project would be until we had some wireframes made. All we knew was that we were going to build an event booking app inspired by Meetup. Ashwanth made the wireframes using a program called Sketch and then Emily took those wireframes to Photoshop to create design concepts. From there, it made it a lot easier to get a feel for what we were building and what functionality would be required.
